# Todo List Application

A simple command-line Todo List application in Python that allows you to manage tasks, sort them, and delete tasks. This is a basic project, but it helped me gain a lot of knowledge. 

## Usage

Run the Todo List application:

   ```shell
   python todo.py
   ```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

1. Add tasks: Enter the task description and priority when prompted.
2. Show tasks: View the list of tasks with their descriptions and priorities.
3. Sort tasks: Choose to sort the tasks by priority or cancel the sorting operation.
4. Delete tasks: Enter the index of the task to mark as completed or remove.

The application will continue running until you choose to exit.
